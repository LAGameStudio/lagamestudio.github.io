This game was inspired by MS-DOS gaming as well as the the 16 and 32-bit console eras. The enemies and scenery in Super Star Shooter 16 all move to the beat of the music. This often creates a sensation of calm focus or feeling \"in the zone\" during gameplay. Super Star Shooter 16 is intended for casual gamers. This game is intended to be very easy to get into, but difficult to master. The control scheme is very simple and does not take long to learn (or relearn). Discover a strange reality while flying through psychedelic simulation. Super Star Shooter 16 is the first game released by JD Video Game Productions. Its available on Steam, Xbox and Atari VCS."
